## Project Description
This project recreates the front page of the historic Urdu newspaper *Daily Jang* using pure HTML.  
The layout replicates the original newspaper’s masthead, banner headline, portrait section, and multi-column articles using semantic HTML5 tags and table-based structure without external CSS.

## Features Implemented
- Table-based 3-column newspaper layout
- Semantic HTML5 tags (`header`, `section`, `article`, `footer`)
- Masthead image and banner headline image
- Center portrait feature section
- Boxed funeral announcement section
- Inline styling for borders and alignment
- Hierarchical headings (`h1`–`h4`)
- Images with alt attributes
- Proper indentation and comments

## Challenges Faced
Recreating the complex newspaper column structure without external CSS required careful use of HTML tables and inline styling. Maintaining visual similarity with the original scan while keeping semantic structure was the main challenge.
